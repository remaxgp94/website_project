# My first website project
This is my fist website project on Github, where you can find some changes and see the result of my work during all product cycle. This repository store not actual product that I'd like to present, but a workplace. I'm studying full-stack web development and this project helps me understand all aspects of developement. If you have advices or any additional information that can help me to reach goals in this field of learning, I'll be more than happy to read. Thank you in advance!

Maksims.
